When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    to sync with my other computer and my friends/peers/collegues

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    The changes I do on my computer are not always the one I want to share

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone : make a copy of a remote or local repository 
    Branch : make a sub version of a repository
    Fork : on GitHub make a personal repo from the repo of someone else

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To compare the state of remote and local ??

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Quite a steep learning curve

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When collaborating it's better to do changes on a separate branch then do a pull request 
    When working alone it's easier to work on the master branch locally than sync it with GitHub for sharing or fetching from another computer.
